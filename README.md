# Riscy-SoC
Riscy-SoC is SoC based on RISC-V CPU core, designed in SystemVerilog

The core uses 64 bit instrustions and is fully compatible with both regular and privilaged ISA, meaning that it supports whole RISC-V ecosystem. Core is based on "I" model.

Target of this SoC is iCE 40 FPGA, but only the models with 7680 LUTs.
