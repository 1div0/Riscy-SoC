# Riscy-SoC
Riscy-SoC is SoC based on RISC-V CPU core, designed in SystemVerilog

The core uses 64 bit instrustions and is fully compatible with both regular and privilaged ISA, meaning that it supports whole RISC-V ecosystem. The core if full IMAC core and the imprementations of all opcodes is planned.
